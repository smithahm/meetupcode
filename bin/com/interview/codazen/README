The solution for coding test is written in Java language. I have created 2 separate class for Students and Course. 
I have used List for Course as it is dynamic array, it is efficient than static array like size need not to be mentioned.
I took 2hours 20 minutes to complete this, have not included many test cases. I have used JUnit to test this along with system.out.println statements in Main class.

The time complexity is O(nlogn) + O(n) = O(nlogn).
O(nlogn) is for sorting logic that I have used. I have used Comparator to sort the Student objects which implicitly used Merge sort so complexity if O(nlogn)
O(n) is to find the intersection between two courses. 

Space complexity is O(n) which is used in Course as ArrayList. where n is the number of Student objects in ArrayList Course.

CourseTest.java - JUnit Testcases
Main.Java - couple of println statements and logic to find intersection
Student.java - Student attributes and their methods
Course.java - Course attributes and their methods.
All these classes are in com.interview.codazen package.
